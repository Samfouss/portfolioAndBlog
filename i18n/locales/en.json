    "overview": "My path in data science began with a solid engineering foundation in statistics from Dakar, Senegal, where I developed core analytical skills. After gaining hands-on experience as a statistician and research assistant, I deepened my expertise through specialized training in biostatistics at Université Laval. Since 2022, I've been applying this multidisciplinary skillset as a data analyst, working at the intersection of biostatistics, bioinformatics, and machine learning. I leverage statistical modeling, l'analyse des données, and modern ML techniques to help solve complex problems.",
